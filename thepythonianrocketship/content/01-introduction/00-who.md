Hello! I'm Touhidul Alam Seyam, currently studying Computer Science and Engineering at BGC Trust University Bangladesh. As a Research Assistant at my university, I have had the opportunity to explore my passion for computer science and technology.
My love for programming began when I was just 12 years old, and I haven't looked back since. I have been working as a Freelance Automation Developer for over three years, using my skills to help clients streamline their operations and increase efficiency. In addition to this, I have worked as a Data Analyst for two years, analyzing complex data sets and providing insights that drive business decisions. More recently, I have expanded my skillset to include web development, allowing me to create dynamic and engaging websites for clients.
Beyond my professional experience, I am also proficient in GoLang and Rust, which I enjoy using for personal projects and experimentation. My interest in artificial intelligence (AI) and artificial general intelligence (AGI) has led me to publish research papers on these topics, and I consider myself an advocate for the potential of these technologies.
In summary, I am a passionate and experienced programmer with expertise in automation, data analysis, web development, and AI/AGI. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow and learn.
